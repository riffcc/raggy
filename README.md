# raggy

"Ruh-roh, Raggy!"

## Purpose
What is this?

Probably nothing.

### Tests
Raggy is primarily developed using Test-Driven Development.

In contrast to normal codebases, this is intended to largely be a living test suite, built and tested by the actual code itself (eventually). AI tools are a first class citizen and part of the development process, for better or for worse.# Iroh Example

A Python project using iroh 0.27.0.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```
